📘 Day 1 – Linux & Git Setup (DevOps 7-Day Project)

This repository is part of a 7-Day DevOps Master Project, where I build a complete microservice + CI/CD + Monitoring + Logging + Kubernetes deployment.

**🚀 Today's Objectives**

+ Learn Linux basics required for a DevOps Engineer

+ Learn essential Git commands

+ Automate system setup using bash scripting

+ Push changes to GitHub as part of real project workflow


📂 **Work Completed Today**

1️⃣ Project Initialization

+ Created project folder: ecommerce-microservice/

+ Initialized a Git repository using:

+ git init

2️⃣ Created Automation Scripts

+ ✔ setup.sh

+ Installs commonly used DevOps tools (Docker, kubectl, MySQL client).

+ ✔ check_port.sh

+ Checks whether a specific port is already in use.

+ Run example:
```bash
./check_port.sh 8080
```
3️⃣ Git Operations

+ Added files to staging:

+ git add .


+ Committed changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Day 1: Linux + Git setup completed"
```

+ Connected to GitHub and pushed the code.

📝 **Assignments Completed Today**

- Wrote a system health script (system_health.sh)

- Created a new Git branch and a Pull Request

- Wrote explanations for Linux basics:

    + Shell

    + Absolute vs relative path

    + Exit status ( echo $?)

    + kill vs kill -9

📚 **Key Learning From Day 1**

+ How Linux handles files, processes, permissions

+ How to use Git for version control

+ How to write practical bash scripts

+ How to organize DevOps project repository
